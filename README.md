#Purpose
As per the design brief, the purpose of this website was to present my creations and skills to potential employers. 

#Functionality / features
The main goal of the website was to make accessing my information as quick and simple as possible. The homepage features previews of my work, my career and my interests, and in each section you can click through the links (as opposed to scrolling, which is slower) to navigate through the site. This is also the reason that the order of content starts with my work, then career, then about me. When you land on the site, you can immediately click into either my games or web portfolio, and from there click into one of the respective projects that are displayed. As an employer, within two clicks you are looking at one of my projects, and I believe this meets the requirements well. 

Further to this, the navigation bar and contact button were kept fixed on the page to support the theme of the site being easily navigated. 

A secondary focus was to keep information overload to a minimum. This is the reason each section in the homepage takes up the entire screen, and when you use the navigation links, the sections centre perfectly. 

In the blog, you can click into a preview to view the post in it's entirety.
